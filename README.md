Hacker School Git roundtable: tips, trick and strategies.

## Tips & tricks

* Nina: `git blame`
* Allison: `git add -p` I wrote this [blog post](http://akaptur.github.io/blog/2012/12/18/git-add-p-the-wave-of-the-future/) about it
* Aki: `git add --patch` && `git stash` ... warnings from the trenches!
* Erik T: `git rebase -i ~HEAD-n` fixups, squashing, and keeing an linear history

## Discussion

* Git stash — what's your workflow, how do you use it?
* Git blame — any stories where you've blamed yourself? Caught the culprit? Do you use it?
* Pull requests from separate repos or merge branches all on the same repo?
* Cherry-picking — how have you used `cherry-pick` in the past?
* Tools of the trade — are you pure CLI, or do you have some GUI tools you rely on?
* Merge conflicts — do you hate these as much as we do?
* DevOps stuff — do you like using Git for deployment (a la Heroku)? How have you used Git for deployment? What were your Production branching strategies?
* Git hooks — do you like setting up hooks for a CI, bug tracker, project management software? Something else cool?
* Personal best practices: rebasing, commit messages, etc.
* Git internals — what happens when you branch? When you pull? Why is it different than an other VCS out there? Love it? Hate it?
* Git is a [persistent data structure](http://www.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/)
